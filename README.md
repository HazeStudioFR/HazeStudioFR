Who is Haze?
-----------------------------------------------------------

I am a c# developer focusing on projects involving RagePluginHook or LSPDFR. I began creating simple mods for GTA V, back in 2019, when I started with EUP textures, which quickly moved to EUP models and ELS/non-ELS vehicles. I had a period where I experimented with coding but wasn't very good at it. It wasn't until a CS class, focused on Java, that I took when I was in high school that I started to try and learn some coding. While I am far from a professional or an expert, I code for enjoyment and continuous learning. 

* 🌍  I'm based in the United States - East Coast
* ✉️  You can contact me on my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/mV9kaACXkM)
* 🚀  I'm currently working on a few different project
  * PulseEMS v2.2 - A plugin for RagePluginHook that aims to bring EMS to the world of crime and streets of the great State of San Andreas.
  * VanillaFR v1.0 - A Plugin for LSPDFR 0.4.9 that aims to override and reinvent some of the "vanilla" LSPDFR features, bringing more ideas, and features, while still keeping the classic LSPDFR look.
* 🤝  I'm open to collaborating on any LSPDFR/RPH Related Projects (RPH > LSPDFR)
* ⚡  I love music and will always take suggestions on good songs for coding/gym/everyday life

And outside of the CS world?

As of writing this, I am 19 years old, born in the United States, and I have a pretty good goal of becoming a Flight Paramedic. Currently, I hold my NREMT-B license, but as of January 13th, I have started Paramedic classes, which will last until early December 2025. I currently hold the "title" of the youngest paid EMT for my station, and hopefully soon to be the youngest Paramedic in my county/state.

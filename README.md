Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is HazeStudioFR, also known as Haze
============================================================================================================================

Hello & Welcome!

I'm Haze, a 20-year-old from the US. My journey into the world of GTA modding began back in mid-2017. I've been quite hands-on, getting into literally everything,

* Programming,
* Clothing Models & Rigging,
* MLOs / Maps,
* Weapons, and more.
 

However, my primary focus is definitely programming! My biggest plugin, called PulseEMS, aims to bring a deep and realistic prehospital experience to the LSPDFR community. It’s been a long road, since I started working on it around 2020, the mod has gone through countless rebrands and rewrites (whoospies). I’m happy (and hopeful) to report that it is currently undergoing its final rewrite, which I chip away at during my free time.

 

My interest in programming started in my sophomore year of high school. I've always been intensely interested in technology and code, initially dabbling in HTML/CSS before moving on to JavaScript. While much of that initial knowledge has faded a bit, my current focus is firmly on C#.

 

Outside of the digital world, I’m a Nationally Registered Paramedic. I have a deep appreciation for prehospital healthcare and HEMS. My career goals are set high, as I aim to become a flight paramedic, a Field Training Officer, and eventually conclude my career by teaching the paramedic curriculum.
